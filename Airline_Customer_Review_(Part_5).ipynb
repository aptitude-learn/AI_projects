If the classifier will be tasked at classifyigng whether patients have cancer or not, we sure need much higher accuracy, on top of, making sure the classifier doesn't make critical mistakes. This brings us to two important types of errors: Type I and Type II errors, which are especially important in problems like diagnosing cancer.\n",

In our case, we need to make sure most negative reviews are flagged, and not be mistakenly labelled as \"positive\". However, we also need to make sure that Delta employers who are working hard do not have to sift through positive reviews in the negative review bunch.
